This repository is used to disseminate all of the code used in my MSc dissertation, titled: Longitudinal latent class and joint modelling of
antiretroviral adherence.

The files include R scripts for data manipulation and cleaning, as well as scripts used to implement various analyses and data visualisations. 
The actual data used in the analysis is not publicly accessible.

The repository is not properly versioned and just houses the final files.
